# Project-Test

This is a simple, team-based web application for tracking personal expenses. Users can record daily expenses, set monthly budgets, and monitor spending categories with visual indicators and calculations.

## Project Goals

- Enable users to set and update category-based budgets
- Provide visual feedback on spending (e.g. progress bars)
- Maintain clear separation of responsibilities between team members

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (Responsive Design)
- JavaScript 
- Git & GitHub for version control

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main Dashboard
- `add-expense.html`: Add new expense
- `budget.html`: Budget management
- `css/`: Style files
- `js/`: Logic functions
- `sample-data.js`: Test data

## Team Branch Structure

Each contributor works on a specific branch according to their role.

| Role                    | Branch Name        |

## Collaboration Guidelines

1. Each developer works only in their assigned branch.
2. All updates must be committed with clear messages.
3. Once a task is complete, create a pull request into `main`.
4. The project manager will review and approve merges.
5. Final production-ready code lives only in `main`.
